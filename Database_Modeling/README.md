# Pharmacist KPI Database Model

This is a project I worked on in a database modeling class of a real-world buisness scenario where the director and manager of a medical therapy managment (MTM) program would like to have an online database and dashboard created with the pharmacist team's KPIs that show individual performance as well as team performance. It includes the business requirements document, a design document, and a db schema for an online database that replaces a reporting process where a team of analyst sends KPI reports to the director and manager via email with spreadsheets files.
